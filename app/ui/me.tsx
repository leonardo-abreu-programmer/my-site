            My name is Leonardo. I am a programmer from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, currently living in Portugal and completing my graduation.<br/><br/>
            I have a job at an influential programming company in Portugal, and I am planning to continue my studies.<br/><br/>
            I am familiar with several programmingges, and I can easily learn new ones. I enjoy learning new design patterns and implementing them in my projects.<br/><br/>
            In the future, I hope to enhance my programming knowledge through work experience, and I am also planning to move to another country to improve my English skills.<br/><br/>
